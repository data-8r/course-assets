    "In the Second Liberian Civil War, which lasted from 1999 to 2003, many children were recruited as soldiers.  By 2009, many of these ex-fighters were working in illegal industries or as mercenaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "An organization called Action On Armed Violence wanted to know whether a program of training and monetary aide could help ex-fighters reintegrate into Liberian society.  Such programs have had mixed results in other contexts, but most of the available evidence was from observational studies, not RCTs.  They identified a candidate group of ex-fighters, randomly assigned them to treatment and control groups, and offered their assistance program to the treatment group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to determine whether the assistance program actually improved outcomes for the people in the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are available [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/11R0LX&version=2.1) and the paper [here](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/publications/994_138_Can-Employment-Reduce-Lawlessness-and-Rebellion_June2015.pdf).  The data come straight from the first link; we haven't modified them at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also be aware that there are many additional questions that go into the design and analysis of an RCT.  For example, some of the people in the experimental group declined to participate, which could become a confounding factor in the analysis if not handled properly.  (Why?)  Many details like that are discussed in the paper."

(`\"raiseanintfut\"` is short for \"raise animals in the future.\"  `\"dum\"` is short for \"dummy,\" which just means the variable is coded as 0 or 1.  `\"end\"` means the variable was measured at the end of the experiment.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some of the people didn't report their interest.  Their `raiseanintfut_dum_end` are labeled as `nan`, which stands for \"not a number.\"  This will cause a problem for any analysis of that column.  They can be removed by choosing only rows where `raiseanintfut_dum_end` is greater than or equal to 0.\n",
