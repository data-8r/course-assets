    "\n",
    "Since schools cost tens of thousands of dollars to attend, the cost-to-attend trait is always a much bigger *number* than most other traits.  That makes it affect the dissimilarity a lot more than other traits.  Two schools that differ in cost-to-attend by \\$900, but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of 900.  But two schools that differ in graduation rate by .9 (a huge difference!), but are otherwise identical, get a dissimilarity of only .9.\n",

    "One way to fix this problem is to assign different \"weights\" to different traits.  For example, we could fix the problem above by multiplying the difference in the cost-to-attend traits by .001, so that a difference of \\$900 in cost-to-attend results in a dissimilarity of $900 \\times .001$, or $.9$.\n",

Use the revised method to compute a revised dissimilarity between Berkeley and Stanford.\n",
