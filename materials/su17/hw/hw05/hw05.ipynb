There are two common measurements of blood pressure: the pressure when your heart beats and pushes blood through your arteries (systolic), and pressure in between heartbeats (diastolic).  We'll focus on systolic pressure for simplicity.  Pressures are measured in units of millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated \"mmHg\".\n",
